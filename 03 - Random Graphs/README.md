# Random Graphs

Given the following `G(6,p)` random graph with probability `p`:

![Undirected graph with N=6 nodes and L=9 edges.](03-random-opt.svg "Random G(6,p) graph.")

What is the likelihood that `p <= 0.5`?

1. `0.0 <= P(p <= 0.5) <= 0.2`
1. `0.2 <= P(p <= 0.5) <= 0.4`
1. `0.4 <= P(p <= 0.5) <= 0.6`
1. `0.6 <= P(p <= 0.5) <= 0.8`
1. `0.8 <= P(p <= 0.5) <= 1.0`
